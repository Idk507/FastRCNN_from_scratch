# Fast R-CNN Object Detection Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a custom implementation of the Fast R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) object detection model using PyTorch. The implementation provides a comprehensive approach to object detection with region proposal and classification.

## Features
- Custom Region Proposal Network (RPN)
- ROI (Region of Interest) Pooling
- Object Detection and Classification
- Supports training and inference modes
- Utilizes VGG16 as the backbone feature extractor

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install pycocotools
```

## Model Architecture
The Fast R-CNN model consists of three main components:
1. **Backbone Network**: VGG16 feature extractor
2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Generates object proposals
3. **ROI Head**: Classifies and refines object proposals

### Key Components
- `RegionProposalNetwork`: Generates and filters region proposals
- `ROIHead`: Performs final classification and bounding box refinement
- `FastRCNN`: Combines backbone, RPN, and ROI Head

## Training
```python
# Example training setup
model = FastRCNN(num_classes=21)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
```

## Inference
```python
# Example inference
model.eval()
predictions = model(input_image)
```

## Key Techniques
- Anchor Generation
- IoU (Intersection over Union) Calculation
- Non-Maximum Suppression
- Smooth L1 Loss
- Adaptive Sampling of Proposals

## Hyperparameters
- Anchor Scales: [128, 256, 512]
- Anchor Aspect Ratios: [0.5, 1, 2]
- Image Normalization: Standard ImageNet normalization
- Resize Range: 600-1000 pixels

## Limitations
- Currently supports a fixed number of classes
- Requires preprocessed ground truth annotations
- Performance may vary based on dataset

## Future Improvements
- Support for dynamic number of classes
- More advanced anchor generation
- Improved proposal filtering
- Multi-scale training and inference
